2. Enter an expression in the format <number> <operator> <number> (e.g., 5 * 6).
3. View the result printed on the screen.

What I Learned:
1. Using Python's input() function for user interaction.
2. Implementing the match-case statement for control flow.
3. Handling basic input validation and error handling.
4. Splitting and parsing strings to process user input.
